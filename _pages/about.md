Hey, this is my landing page for academic purposes.

My name is **Otto**, and I am a physicist working on mathematical aspects of quantum condensed matter physics. In my PhD, which I am pursuing as part of the [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie PhD Fellowship TENORS](https://tenors-network.eu/dc-10-geometry-of-tensor-network-varieties-for-quantum-condensed-matter-physics/), I apply methods from algebraic geometry to problems in quantum many-body physics.

A central object of my research is **tensor networks** in various forms. These networks are powerful tools for gaining both numerical and conceptual insights into complex quantum systems and have become increasingly popular in recent years. Mathematically, tensor networks can be viewed as **rational maps** from a parameter space to an embedding space. Since these maps are polynomial, they define varieties in the embedding space cut out by their coordinate functions.  

Studying tensor networks through this **algebro-geometric lens** raises the level of abstraction and can lead to new insights into how these networks represent physical systems.
