Hey, this is my landing page for academic purposes. 

My name is Otto. I am a physicist working on mathematical topics. In my PhD, which I am doing in the frame of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie PhD Fellowship [TENORS][https://tenors-network.eu/dc-10-geometry-of-tensor-network-varieties-for-quantum-condensed-matter-physics/], I am applying methods from algebraic geometry to problems in quantum condensed matter physics. 

In this context, the main object of my studies are tensor networks of various forms. These networks can be applied to gain numerical and conceptual insight into complex quantum many-body systems and have gained popularity over the recent years. In mathematical terms, tensor networks can also be seen as rational maps from a parameter space into an embedding space. Since these maps are polynomial, we can easily define a variety in the embedding cut out by the coordinate function of said map. Studiying the tensor networks in this algebro-geometric fashion increases the abstraction level of the networks and can lead to interesting insights as to how they represent physical systems.
